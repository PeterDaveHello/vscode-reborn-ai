## Local LLMs and Proxies

### Proxies

I've set up a proxy for anyone that needs it at `https://openai-proxy.dev/v1`. It's running [x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI](https://github.com/x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI) code on CloudFlare Workers. This is mainly for anyone who wants to use OpenAI, but cannot due to api.openai.com being blocked.

## Tech

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - [VSCode Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- The UI is built with TailwindCSS. But, respecting VSCode's UI consistency and theme support is still a priority.
- This does not use VSCode's [WebView UI Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit/tree/main/src). But, I'm open to switching to the WebView UI toolkit since it better aligns with VSCode's UI.
